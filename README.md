# FourSquareCipher
C++ program for encrypting text files using the four-square cipher encryption technique

# Introduction
The four-square cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique which utilizes four 5×5 matrices of letters arranged in a square. Each of these 5×5 squares contain all of the letters of the alphabet, though leaving out the letter Q to bring it down to fit in 25 characters. The plaintext is split into digraphs (pairs of two letters) and then encrypted by laying a grid over the four squares and identifying the intersections of the letters (see further explanation at https://learncryptography.com/classical-encryption/four-square-cipher)
